# Contributing

Thanks for being interested! Here's our guidelines to contributing to the templates.

## Get Set Up

- Submit a ticket if it hasn't. Be sure to be clear and give instructions on how to reproduce the issue you're having.

    - `git checkout -b issue/number-brief-issue-description`

## Submit!
- Push your changes.
- Submit a pull request.
- We will review your changes and try to respond in a timely manner.

That's it!
